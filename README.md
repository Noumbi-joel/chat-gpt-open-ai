## Project Title
Chat GPT Clone @openai

## Project Description
* Chat GPT clone is a web app in which you can talk everything you want with a partial open source AI called Chat GPT.
* I've decided to use: **Next.js** because it is a very powerful backend framework that helps you to build powerful and scalable web apps and also because it implements Static Side Generation, Incremental Side Regeneration and Server Side Generation.**Typescript** is a javascript superset and i used it because of the structural aspect of the language (**types**, **interfaces**, **classes**...). **TailwindCSS** is a very nice library that is used to facilitate the writting of **CSS** in just few lines. **Firebase Firestore** is used in this project because it's very powerful and easily maintanable cloud database.
* During the development i faced off the difficulty of using the firebase-admin library because when you ask a question to chat gpt it will reply you by saving his response in the database so he needs to have access rights to complete the task.

## How to Use
* You need firstly to authenticate yourself using google authentication, Then, you'll see the home page
* You have to create a chat in order to communicate with the AI.
* When you reach the chat interface, just write something in the input field and wait a bit while **Chat GPT is thinking...**
* By the way, you can create multiple chats if you want to talk differents topics for example.
